## Tasks
> Starting from this task you should use ONLY functional components

1. At first show a button with text `Start` on the page
1. After clicking the button shows a `GoodsList` (ul > li) with the given goods and hide the `Start` button
1. Add button with text `Reverse` to show the goods in reversed order
1. Add button with text `Sort alphabetically` to show the goods in alphabetical order
1. Add button with text `Reset` to show the goods in the initial order
1. Add button with text `Sort by length` to show the goods ordered by name length

## (*) Advanced tasks (require understanding of Forms in React)
1. Add `<select>` with numbers from 1 to 10. (1 is default). All the previous buttons
  should now show only goods having length >= than the selected value. When you change the
  value the items should be immediately re-rendered accordingly.
1. `Reset` button should set the default value to the `<select>`
